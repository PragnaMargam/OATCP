The algorithm aims to find the largest possible number that can be formed by concatenating the given integers. It first converts each integer to its string representation and stores them in a vector. Then, it checks if the sum of all numbers is zero; if so, it immediately returns "0" since there are no non-zero numbers to form a larger number. Otherwise, it sorts the string representations of numbers in non-ascending order based on a custom comparison function that compares concatenations of two strings in both orders. This sorting ensures that the largest possible number is formed by arranging the numbers such that the concatenation yields the greatest result. Finally, it concatenates the sorted strings to form the largest possible number and returns it. The algorithm thus efficiently determines the maximum number that can be created from the given integers.
