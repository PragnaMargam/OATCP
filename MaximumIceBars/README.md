The algorithm employs a straightforward approach to determine the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can purchase with the available coins. It starts by counting the frequency of each ice cream's cost, ensuring an understanding of how many ice cream bars are available at each price point. Subsequently, it iterates through all possible ice cream costs, beginning from the cheapest and proceeding to the most expensive. For each cost encountered, the algorithm calculates the total cost of purchasing all available ice cream bars at that price. It then compares this total cost with the number of coins the boy has. If the boy can afford to buy all available ice cream bars at that cost, it adds the count of ice cream bars to the total. It repeats this process until the boy can no longer afford to buy any more ice cream bars or until all costs have been considered. Finally, the algorithm returns the total count of ice cream bars purchased, which represents the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy within the given budget.
