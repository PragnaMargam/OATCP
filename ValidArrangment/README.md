This code implements an algorithm to find a valid arrangement of pairs that form an Eulerian path in a graph. An Eulerian path is a path that traverses each edge of a graph exactly once, with the possibility of nodes having more than one incoming and outgoing connection. Here's a detailed explanation of how the algorithm works:

-> Input and Data Structures
- The input is a list of pairs representing directed edges between nodes.
- The code uses `unordered_map` and `stack` for efficient graph representation and traversal.

->Building the Graph
- The code first creates two maps, `inDegree` and `outDegree`, to keep track of the incoming and outgoing degrees for each node.
- It also creates an adjacency list `adjList` using an `unordered_map<int, stack<int>>`, which stores the neighbors of each node.

->Determining the Start Node
- The algorithm then finds a starting node (`source`) for the Eulerian path.
- If a node has one more outgoing edge than incoming edge, it is likely the start of the Eulerian path.
- If there's no unique start, it defaults to the first node in `adjList`.

->Traversing the Graph
- The code uses a recursive depth-first traversal method (`traverseGraph`) to construct the Eulerian path.
- It begins at the `source` node and continues to traverse the graph, removing each edge after it's used to avoid loops.
- As the traversal progresses, the edges are pushed onto the result stack in reverse order.

->Generating the Valid Arrangement
- After the graph traversal, the code reverses the result to get the correct path order.
- If the resulting path length doesn't match the original number of pairs, it indicates that no valid arrangement could be made, which might occur due to cycles or unconnected segments.

->Main Function Workflow
- The main function asks the user for the number of pairs and then reads each pair, storing them in a vector.
- An instance of `Solution` is created to find a valid arrangement.
- If the returned arrangement is empty, indicating that no valid path was found, the code outputs "No arrangements possible."
- Otherwise, it prints the valid arrangement, confirming that an Eulerian path exists in the given pairs.

->key Concepts
- The primary goal is to find an Eulerian path, which requires careful tracking of in-degrees and out-degrees.
- The recursive traversal uses a stack to manage the traversal order and ensure each edge is used only once.
- The check for a valid arrangement compares the resulting path's length with the initial number of pairs to validate the correctness of the Eulerian path. If they don't match, there's no valid arrangement.
