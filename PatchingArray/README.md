This repository hosts a C++ solution for tackling the patching array problem, aimed at determining the minimum number of patches needed to construct an array comprising positive integers from 1 to n, inclusive.

Algorithm Overview:

Begin by defining a function called fx, which takes a vector nums containing integers and an integer n as inputs.
Initialize two variables, mx and ans, to 0.
Traverse through each element num in the nums vector:
While num exceeds (mx + 1), increment ans and update mx to 2 * mx + 1.
If mx surpasses or equals n, return ans.
Update mx by adding num.
If mx surpasses or equals n, return ans.
If mx is still less than n, continue incrementing ans until mx surpasses or equals n.
Return ans, representing the minimum number of patches required.
Implementation Details:

The implementation is written in C++, comprising a single main function.
Input is read from the file named sample_input1.txt, which contains a vector nums and an integer n.
The function fx is invoked to calculate the minimum number of patches required.
The outcome is then written to sample_output1.txt for further reference.
