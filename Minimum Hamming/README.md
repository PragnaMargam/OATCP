To find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers, we can iterate through each bit position in the 32-bit integers. For each bit position, we count the number of set bits (1s) and unset bits (0s). Let's denote the count of set bits as `k` and the count of unset bits as `n - k`, where `n` is the total number of integers.

For a particular bit position, the total Hamming distance is the product of the counts of set bits and unset bits. This is because for each set bit, there are `n - k` unset bits in other integers, contributing `n - k` differences in Hamming distance. Thus, the total Hamming distance for this bit position would be `k * (n - k)`.

To find the total Hamming distance for all bit positions, we iterate through each bit position and sum up the Hamming distances calculated as described above.

The overall time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the total number of integers, and the space complexity is O(1) constant, as we are not using any additional data structures.
here's the algorithm explained for the provided code:

1. Initialize variables: 
   - If the input array `nums` is empty, return 0, as there are no elements to compare.
   - Set `k` to the size of the `nums` array. This represents the total number of integers.
   - Initialize an array `bits` of size 32 (to accommodate 32-bit integers), representing the count of set bits at each bit position. Initialize all elements of `bits` to 0.

2. Count set bits:
   - Iterate through each integer `n` in the `nums` array.
   - For each integer `n`, iterate through its bits.
   - While `n` is greater than 0, increment the count of set bits in the corresponding bit position of the `bits` array and right-shift `n` to check the next bit.

3. Calculate total Hamming distance:
   - Initialize `ans` to 0, which will store the total Hamming distance.
   - Iterate through each element `n` in the `bits` array.
   - For each element `n`, calculate the Hamming distance contribution for that bit position as `n * (k - n)`, where `n` is the count of set bits at that position and `k - n` is the count of unset bits. Add this contribution to `ans`.

4. Return the total Hamming distance:
   - Return the calculated `ans` as the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.

The algorithm iterates through each integer and each bit position only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the total number of integers in the input array. Since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (the `bits` array of size 32), the space complexity is O(1).
