This repository presents a C++ solution tackling a problem that involves determining the minimum possible number by removing k digits from a given string representation of a number.

Algorithm Outline:
1. Define a function, fx, which accepts a string, s, representing the number, and an integer, k, indicating the number of digits to remove.
2. Initialize a stack, st, to store the digits of the number.
3. Traverse each digit of the input string:
   - Compare the current digit with the top of the stack. If the current digit is smaller than the top of the stack and there are remaining digits to remove (k > 0), pop digits from the stack until either the stack is empty or the top of the stack is smaller than or equal to the current digit.
   - If the stack is empty and the current digit is '0', proceed to the next digit.
   - Push the current digit onto the stack.
4. If there are still digits to remove after processing all digits, pop digits from the stack until k becomes 0.
5. If the stack is empty, return "0" as there are no remaining digits after removal.
6. Otherwise, construct the minimum number string by popping digits from the stack and appending them to the result string.
7. Return the resultant string.

Implementation Details:
- The implementation is in C++ and comprises a single main function.
- It reads the input string, s, and the integer, k, from the input file, input2.txt.
- Subsequently, it invokes the function fx to determine the minimum possible number after removing k digits.
- Finally, it outputs the resulting string to the output file, output2.txt.

Overall, this approach efficiently computes the minimum number after removing k digits, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's intricacies and employing an effective algorithmic strategy.
