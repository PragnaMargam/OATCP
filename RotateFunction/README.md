To calculate F(K), which represents the maximum rotation function value for a rotation of K steps:
> Start with the previous rotation function value F(K-1).
> Add the total sum of the array elements (SUM).
> Subtract N times the (K-1)th element from the end of the array.
In simpler terms, to get the maximum rotation function value for K steps, you take the previous value and adjust it by adding the sum of all elements and subtracting N times the (K-1)th element from the end of the array.
