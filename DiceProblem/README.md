In the provided algorithm, a list named `dp` of integers is created to hold the count of ways to achieve each sum from 0 to `n`, with all elements initialized to 0. The algorithm then sets `dp[0]` to 1 since there's only one way to obtain a sum of 0 (by not throwing the dice). It iterates through each possible outcome of throwing a dice, ranging from 1 to 6. For each outcome `i`, the algorithm updates the `dp` list to calculate the number of ways to achieve each sum from `i` to `n`. Within the outer loop, there's an inner loop that iterates through the possible sums from `i` to `n`. For each sum `j`, `dp[j]` is updated by adding the count of ways to achieve the sum `j - i`. After updating all the counts, the algorithm returns the value stored in `dp[n]`, representing the number of ways to obtain the desired sum `n` using the outcomes of throwing the dice.

In the main function, the algorithm reads the number of test cases, denoted as `t`. For each test case, it reads the target sum, `sum`. If the target sum is negative (which is impossible), it prints "Not Possible". Otherwise, it computes and prints the number of ways to obtain the sum using the `countWays` function. Overall, this algorithm efficiently calculates the number of ways to achieve a given sum using outcomes of throwing a dice, handling invalid inputs appropriately.
