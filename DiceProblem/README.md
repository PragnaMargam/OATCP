To compute the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, restricted to moving only right and down through open cells ('.'), we begin by creating a grid named dp with dimensions n×n, initialized with zeros. This grid serves to hold the count of paths to reach each cell. If the starting cell at the top-left corner is open ('.'), we set dp[0][0] to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

Next, we traverse the first row and first column of the grid. For each cell in these rows or columns, if the cell is open ('.'), we update the corresponding cell in dp. For cells in the first column, we set them to the value of the cell above, and for cells in the first row, we set them to the value of the cell to the left.

Proceeding, we iterate through each cell in the grid, starting from position (1, 1) up to (n-1, n-1). For each open cell encountered during this iteration, we update dp[i][j] by adding the number of paths from the cell above (dp[i−1][j]) and the number of paths from the cell to the left (dp[i][j−1]).

Finally, the value stored in dp[n−1][n−1] represents the total number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, adhering to the specified movement constraints. This value is returned as the desired result.
