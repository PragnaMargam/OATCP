We can adopt a straightforward approach to traverse the array, multiplying elements as we go. If the current product is greater than the previously stored maximum product, we update the maximum product. Whenever we encounter a "0" in the array, we reset the product to 1 because the next element will begin a new subarray.

However, a problem arises when the array contains an odd number of negative elements. In this scenario, to ensure that the product of the negative elements is positive, we need to reject one negative element. Since we're considering subarrays, simply rejecting any one negative element won't suffice. We must choose between rejecting the first or the last negative element.

If we traverse from the start, we can only reject the last negative element, and if we traverse from the end, we can only reject the first negative element. Thus, we need to traverse the array from both ends. From each traversal, we will select the maximum product subarray that results from rejecting either the first or the last negative element.

Therefore, we compare the maximum products obtained from traversing from both ends and choose the maximum among them as our final answer. This approach ensures that we consider the maximum product subarray with the optimal rejection of negative elements.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
