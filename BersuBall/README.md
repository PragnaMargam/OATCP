The algorithm in the provided code efficiently tackles the task of pairing individuals based on their dancing skills. Initially, it identifies the minimum excluded number (mex) by traversing through the array of dancing skills. If mex is found to be 0, it outputs a fixed pair and proceeds to the next test case. Otherwise, it continues to locate the second minimum excluded number (m) from the remaining skill levels. If m matches the mex, implying that valid pairs can be formed, it generates pairs accordingly and outputs them. However, if no valid pairs can be formed, it outputs -1. This process is repeated for each test case, ensuring all scenarios are handled effectively. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates optimizations such as input/output synchronization to enhance its efficiency during execution.
