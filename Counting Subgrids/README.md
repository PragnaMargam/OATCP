the algorithm explained for the provided code:

1. Input Validation:
   - Take the size of the grid (`numRows` and `numCols`) as input from the user.

2. Grid Initialization:
   - Create a 2D vector `grid` of size `numRows x numCols` to store the elements of the grid.
   - Populate the grid by taking input from the user for each element (0 or 1).

3. Bitwise Representation:
   - For each row in the grid, create an integer `rowBits` to represent the bitwise OR of each element in that row. This is done to represent the pattern of ones and zeros in each row in a single integer.

4. Counting Subgrids:
   - Iterate through each pair of rows in the grid using nested loops (`i` and `j`).
   - For each pair of rows, calculate the bitwise AND of their corresponding `rowBits` to find the common bits.
   - Count the number of set bits (ones) in the result of the bitwise AND using the `__builtin_popcount` function. This gives the number of common bits between the two rows.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of common bits, which represents the number of subgrids with all ones that can be formed using these two rows. This is done by `(commonBits * (commonBits - 1)) / 2`, as each pair contributes one subgrid, and we want to avoid double counting.
   - Accumulate the count of subgrids in the variable `subgridCount`.

5. Output:
   - Return the total count of subgrids (`subgridCount`) as the result.

This algorithm leverages bitwise operations to represent the rows of the grid compactly and efficiently. By calculating the common bits between pairs of rows, it identifies subgrids with all ones and accumulates their count. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns, due to the nested loop structure iterating over each pair of rows. However, it optimizes the calculation of common bits using bitwise operations, resulting in efficient computation.
